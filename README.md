# Gamestop and Tesla Stock and Revenue Dashboard

Welcome to my Python project for the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). This project demonstrates my skills in Python, data extraction, web scraping, data visualization, and creating interactive dashboards. The objective is to analyze and visualize stock and revenue data for Gamestop (GME) and Tesla.

## Project Description

This project simulates real-world tasks in data analysis. I have performed the following tasks:

### 1. Define a Function that Makes a Graph

A custom function that assists in creating informative graphs is provided. This function will be used throughout the project to enhance the visualization of the data.

### 2. Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data

In this step, I used the `yfinance` library to extract historical stock data for both Gamestop (GME) and Tesla. The extracted data includes stock prices, volume, and other relevant metrics.

### 3. Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data

To analyze the revenue of Tesla, I employed web scraping techniques to extract the necessary revenue data. This data is essential for a comprehensive analysis.

### 4. Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data

Continuing with the `yfinance` library, I extracted additional stock data. 

### 5. Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data

Similar to Step 3, I extracted revenue data, but this time for Gamestop (GME) using web scraping techniques.

### 6. Plot Tesla Stock Graph

With both stock and revenue data for Tesla, I created interactive graphs to visualize Tesla's stock performance over the specified period.

### 7. Plot GameStop Stock Graph

Finally, I plotted interactive graphs to visualize Gamestop's (GME) stock performance based on the extracted data.

By completing these tasks, I demonstrated my ability to work with financial data, utilize web scraping for information extraction, and create informative visualizations. This project showcases my proficiency in Python for data science and serves as an essential step in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
